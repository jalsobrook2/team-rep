## **CSC-425 Deliverable 2: User Research & Problem Definition Submission** 

**Student Name:** Ethan Sexton  
 **Branch Name:** `esexton-dev`  
 **Date Submitted:** August 31, 2025

### **Target User Group**

People who are both looking to volunteer around their community and those wanting to host volunteer projects. 

### **Problem Description**

	Many students from middle school to college are looking for chances to volunteer around their community, rather it be for club participation requirements or the betterment of their community. In addition, many leaders of non-profit organizations can struggle to find the wanted amount of volunteers via traditional methods.

### **Evidence of the Problem**

* “A study of 2,000 adults revealed a lack of information (22 per cent) and limited awareness of local charities (20 per cent) are the main reasons holding 52 per cent back,” ([The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/26921338/half-brits-wants-volunteer-unaware-find-charities/)).

* “Dull and mind-numbing work is keeping people from volunteering. An estimated 148.8 million\* Americans (58 percent) say they would be encouraged to volunteer if non-profit organizations had better tech tools for them to use while volunteering. This jumps up to just over two-thirds (68 percent) among Americans who have volunteered in the past or are currently volunteering… Bottom line: volunteers want to have an impact—not spend their time on data entry” ([Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/report-better-tech-encourages-more-volunteers))

* I have reached out to a community member who runs an advocacy group and am waiting to hear back from them.

### **“How Might We” Statement**

**How might we increase awareness of volunteering opportunities for non-profit coordinators who may lack attention needed for projects to succeed?**

### **Ethical Lens Applied**

**Principle:** **Awareness and Fairness**

* **Application:** Unequal access to volunteer opportunities and underutilization of community goodwill.

* **Stakeholders Impacted:** Previous volunteers, future volunteers, non-profit organization heads, those impacted by these projects.

* **Professional Standard:** Aligns with ACM Code of Ethics 3.1: *“Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.”*
