### **Target User Group**

> **Local Gig Workers and Task Requesters**  
> Busy professionals needing task assistance and people seeking flexible, global & local side work opportunities, with emphasis on safety and accessibility.

### **Problem Description**

Current gig economy platforms lack local focus and have significant safety vulnerabilities that disproportionately affect women and differently-abled workers. Existing platforms like Fiverr emphasize remote work but offer poor local job discovery, while ride-share and delivery apps are too narrowly focused. Users struggle to find safe opportunities for diverse tasks like tutoring, landscaping, tech help, and household services.

### **Evidence of the Problem**

- According to Human Rights Watch (2025), **major gig platforms use opaque algorithms** that leave workers uncertain about pay until after completing jobs, creating financial insecurity.

- Research from 2024 shows that "gig workers face significant challenges, such as a lack of social protections, algorithmic control, intense competition, and downward pressure on wages."

### **"How Might We" Statement**

> **How might we create a safer, locally-focused gig platform that connects task requesters with nearby workers while prioritizing safety verification, fair payment protection, and accessibility for all users?**

### **Ethical Lens Applied**

**Principle:** **Safety and harm prevention in Gig Work**

- **Application:** This issue violates the principle of protecting vulnerable workers by exposing them to bad actor employers and unsafe working conditions.

- **Stakeholders Impacted:** Gig workers, Busy professionals seeking reliable help, and local communities looking to build economic connections.

- **Professional Standard:** Aligns with ACM Code of Ethics 1.2: *"Avoid harm"* by prioritizing worker safety through proper vetting, secure payment systems, and community support features that protect against exploitation and dangerous situations.
