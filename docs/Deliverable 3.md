## Market Size & Opportunity

The total addressable market (TAM) for temporary and volunteer work is vast, as it encompasses gig economy workers, part-time job seekers, freelancers, and non-profit organizations globally. In the U.S. alone, there are over 60 million people engaged in some form of gig work, and volunteerism is at an all-time high with over 77 million Americans volunteering annually. With a growing shift towards remote and flexible work, the serviceable available market (SAM) is a large subset of this base, representing those actively seeking temp or volunteer work.

Estimating a serviceable obtainable market (SOM), we focus on those who use mobile apps for job searching—currently around 100 million people in the U.S. and globally, hundreds of millions are looking for temp or volunteer opportunities online.

| Market Category | Estimated Size | Details |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| TAM (Total Market) | $500 Billion+ | Gig economy & volunteer sector globally |
| SAM (Serviceable Market) | $100 Billion+ | U.S. market for temp, contract, and volunteer work |
| SOM (Obtainable Market) | $5-10 Billion | U.S. mobile app users actively seeking work |

## **Gaps to Fill**:

* **Matching Technology**: Implement an AI-based matching system for temp/volunteer roles tailored to specific skills and user preferences.
